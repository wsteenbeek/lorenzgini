Description: This package plots Lorenz curves and calculates the Gini coefficient
    which that can be used to describe the concentration of events across units of analysis.
    When there are fewer events than units of analysis, Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients are
    not easily comparable. Bernasco & Steenbeek 2017 (https://doi.org/10.1007/s10940-016-9324-7)
    derive adjustments to the Gini for these situations, which are implemented in this package.
